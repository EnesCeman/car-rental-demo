# Car Rental Website Project

This project is inspired by a car rental website example from the official React website, which can be found [here](https://reactjsexample.com/a-car-rental-website-built-with-react/). The purpose of this project was to delve into React and CSS, particularly focusing on CSS styling and various aspects of front-end development. Here are some key points about this project:

## Overview

- **Learning Opportunity**: The motivation behind this project was to gain a deeper understanding of React and enhance CSS skills. After completing several backend-focused projects, it was an excellent opportunity to focus on the frontend.

- **Partial Implementation**: The entire car rental website was not replicated. Instead, specific components and features that piqued interest were implemented. This includes creating a car picker, designing a modal, and recreating an interactive FAQ section with dropdown menus.

- **SASS Exploration**: The project originally utilized SASS, a CSS preprocessor. This project served as an opportunity to learn how to set up SCSS files and compile them into the main CSS file used in the application.

- **Create React App (CRA)**: The project was bootstrapped using Create React App (CRA), which provides a convenient starting point for React applications.

- **Modular Modal Component**: A departure from the original example, the modal functionality was refactored into a separate component, enhancing modularity and maintainability.

- **State Management**: Unlike the example, where state management was distributed, this project employs a single object to manage multiple states more efficiently.

- **FontAwesome Integration**: The original example used `<i>` tags for FontAwesome icons, which resulted in issues when deployed. This project successfully integrated FontAwesome icons using `<FontAwesomeIcon>` components.

- **CSS Animations**: An animated loader was implemented using CSS, contributing to a more dynamic user experience.

- **DatePicker Enhancement**: The date picker functionality was improved by setting limits on selectable dates, making it more realistic. The date-fns library was employed for this purpose.

- **Broadened CSS Skillset**: Through this project, a wide range of CSS skills was developed, leading to increased confidence in handling complex styling and design challenges.
